# IT extended matura
Tips for what to do and don't do during the IT extended matura exam.

## Tips (thanks juby :pray:)
- Skip Excel - skip all excel questions/tasks at first
- Use SQL, don't use Access - You should have phpMyAdmin installed
- Use python - Even for pseudocode tasks, it's so much easier to verify than actual non-executable pseudocode
- If you have time at the end of the exam, go back and do Excel tasks
