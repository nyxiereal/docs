# INF02 theoretical
So the exam is split into two parts, practical and theoretical, I already analyzed the practical part, and now I will focus on the theoretical part. I'll go over all the parts covered in the theoretical part of the exam.

:::important Warning!
This only covers a small part of the repeating and common questions!
