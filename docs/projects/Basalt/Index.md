# Basalt

Basalt is a lightweight, closed-source app for managing your eduVulcan account.
:::warning Why closed-source?
Well, after Vulcan shut down Wulkanowy and szkolny.eu summer-2024, I decided that I should build my own eduVulcan-compatible application, just to keep tabs on my grades, timetable, etc. easier. I don't want to be sued, and I'm not redistributing the app in any way, shape, or form.

:::warning Do not ask for access
You will probably have a better time with eduVulcan Premium, it is paid, but only requires a yearly payment of ~50pln, for one account (as in your parent can buy it, and your child will also get premium features)
