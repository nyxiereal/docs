:::tip Spawning
The map *should* be fairly clear of enemies at the start, old birds almost always begin spawning after ~14:00.

3. After it has become too dangerous to gather items, the Fire exit crew should execute the back Cruiser jump [yellow path], while the Main exit crew goes back to the ship [purple path].
