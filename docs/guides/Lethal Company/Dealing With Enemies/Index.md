| Enemy    | Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Thumper  | They are deaf and have difficulties turning corners, you can anger them by walking into their line of sight and then loop around a corridor to stun them (if they hit a wall they get stunned for a few seconds and lose all their speed). Use a shovel to beat them to death, they take 5 hits to kill.                |
| Coilhead | They are invulnerable, you cannot kill them, but they get stunned when they hit a wall or another object. They take a few seconds to recover, so you can run away.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Jester   | They are invulnerable, you cannot kill them. When they first spot you you have 13-21 seconds till they start cranking their box. Then you have 35-40 seconds to leave the facility before they enter their chasing stage, insta-killing any player they come across. On average **you have 54.5 seconds till they pop** |
| Old Bird | They are invulnerable, you cannot kill them. They are fairly slow, but can speed up. Their rockets go in a random direction, good luck avoiding them. **If they start flying up, crouch and seek shelter immediately**, they are looking for players or other outdoor enemies to kill.                                  |
