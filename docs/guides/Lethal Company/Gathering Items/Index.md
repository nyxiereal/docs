# Gathering Items

1. You should NEVER go deeper into the facility with scrap, leave them as close to an exit as possible, then pick them up on your way back to the exit. This ensures you can explore deeper parts of the facility without worrying about carrying items.
2. If you are carrying items, you should always be ready to drop them and run, I recommend using the [General Improvements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ShaosilGaming/GeneralImprovements/) mod and setting ScrollDelay to 0.05 or 0.1.
3. You should never pick up easter eggs, they are not worth the pain of randomly exploding. Just leave them be and do NOT pick them up.
