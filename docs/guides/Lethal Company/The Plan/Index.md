# The Plan
The hypotherical "best plan" to survive in Lethal Company the longest. Based off personal experience and knowledge of the game mechanics. This plan is not guaranteed to work, but it should give you a good chance of surviving.

## First Quota - 130C
1. In the lobby, buy 2 shovels. Use the command `sho2` to buy them in the terminal.
2. Go to Adamance for all 3 days (unless it's stormy or eclipsed, then go to march or offense)
3. On the final day, go to the company, sell **ONLY** for the quota, and then leave. With the spare money buy 3 shovels and spend the rest on whatever you want (unless the jetpack is on sale, then buy it first, you can oversell then).

## Second Quota - 182.81 - 289.69*
1. Go to Adamance for all 3 days (unless it's stormy or eclipsed, then go to march or offense)
2. On the final day, go to the company, oversell just enough to be sure you get 700C, and then leave.

## Third Quota - 244.94 - 477.56*
1. Go to Titan (700C), with the spare money buy enough shovels to have 3 in total, and spend the rest on whatever you want.
2. Go to Titan for all 3 days. If it is eclipsed or stormy, one person (prefferably with the least sanity or the one who knows the least about the game) should stay in the ship.
:::tip If you're staying in the ship
- Make sure to **always crouch**
- Make sure to not be distracted by non-game related things
- Make sure to have your microphone muted, only unmute it when you are sure there are no eyeless dogs around
- You can use the monitor to check up on your teammates, unlock any doors (just input the code in the terminal). You can use the `view monitor` command to have a better view of the monitor.

3. On the final day, go to the company, oversell just enough to be sure you get 700C, and then leave.

## Repeat steps 1-3 until you reach quota requirement of 1300C
1. Oversell just enough to be sure you get 1500C, and then leave.
2. Go to Artiface, follow the Artiface Route.
3. On the final day, go to the company, oversell just enough to be sure you get 1500C, and then leave.

## Repeat steps 1-3, you will soon reach as much money as you want

* You realistically will not sell the perfect amount of scrap, so you will have to oversell a bit more than the minimum amount. All information was taken from the [LC Wiki Quota page](https://lethal.miraheze.org/wiki/Quota).
