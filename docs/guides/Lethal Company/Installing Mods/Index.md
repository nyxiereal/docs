# Installing Mods

:::warning Do not use Thunderstore Mod Manager
Thunderstore Mod Manager is just a wrapper around r2modman that injects ads and telemetry into the application. Use r2modman instead.
:::

1. Download and install [r2modman from this link](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest)

:::tip Recommended Mods
My recommended mods are:
- GeneralImprovements - Adds a lot of quality of life improvements.
- Hold_Scan_Button - Allows you to just hold the scan button instead of clicking it repeatedly.
- ShipLoot - You can view what scrap you have collected in the ship, along with the total value of the scrap.
- EladsHUD - A way better HUD, that shows you more detailed information about your health, stamina, and other useful things.
- LethalConfig - Adds a menu to change mod configs in-game.
- FOV_Adjusted - Allows you to adjust the field of view, really useful if you have a bigger monitor
- Minimap (by Tyzeron) - Adds a minimap to the game, which is very useful for navigation.
- ControlCompanyFilter - Flags every lobby that has the "ControlCompany" cheat mod enabled, so you can avoid them.
