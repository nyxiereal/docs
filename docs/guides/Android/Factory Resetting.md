# Factory resetting
Before factory resetting your device to install a new ROM, fix issues, or just to have a fresh start, you should always back up your most important data.

## List of things to backup
- Contacts - Export your contacts to a VCF file
- Call logs - Go to settings and export them to a JSON file
- Messages - Go to settings and export them to a JSON file
- Photos - I personally just have an Immich server with automatic uploads, but you might not. Remember to check these paths: `DCIM`, `Pictures` and `Downloads`
- Aliucord - Copy the `Aliucord` folder from your internal storage
- Telegram - Make sure to be logged in on your PC or another device, so you can log back in after the reset
- KeePassXC - If you use it, copy your database file/s to a safe place
- Aegis - If you use it, copy your database file/s to a safe place
