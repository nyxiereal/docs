# Google is NOT killing sideloading

Recently Google has announced that they're bringing in some "security" changes to installing "unauthorized" applications on Android.

## What Google is doing
1. They are making it slightly harder to install APK files
2. They are introducing an annoyance to the installation process by adding more prompts and warnings

## What Google is NOT doing
1. They are not completely blocking the installation of APK files
2. They are not removing the ability to sideload apps

## Impact range
Who this change will/won't affect. Yes, some people are unaffected.

### Will affect
1. People who still have the *useless* "Play Protect" feature enabled, and cannot/will not disable it
2. People who use Gapps, are more likely to encounter issues or annoyances while trying to sideload an application than microG users

### Won't affect
1. People who have disabled "Play Protect"
2. People who use microG instead of Gapps
3. People who do not use 3rd party stores/applications, aka users who ONLY use the Play Store
4. Rooted users who use the BKI (BetterKnownInstalled) module to spoof an app as "Google Play Certified" - installed from the play store
